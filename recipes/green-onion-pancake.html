  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Chinese scallion pancakes are always a hit at dim sum. You've likely seen them as an appetizer or side dish to
     go with the stir-fry dishes that you love. But did you know you could make an even tastier version at home?</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <p>All Purpose Flour</p>
  <p>Water</p>
  <p>Salt</p>
  <p>Vegetable oil</p>
  <p>Green Onions
  </p>
  <h2>Cooking Directions</h2>
  <h3>Prepare the dough</h3>
  <p>1. Slowly add the hot water to the flour and mix it at the same time</p>
  <p>2. Mix until the hot water is fully absorbed</p>
  <p>3. Slowly add the cold water and continue mixing</p>
  <p>4. Dough flakes should form once all the water is added</p>
  <p>5. Start to press everything together with your hand</p>
  <p>6. You can add more water if there is too much dry flour left, or add more flour if the dough is very sticky. You should have little to no dry flour left when done.</p>
  <p>7. Knead about 5 mins until the dough becomes tougher</p>
  <p>8. Let rest for 20 minutes, then knead for 1 minute to form a smooth dough.</p>
  <h3>Prepare the filling</h3>
  <p>1. Add dry ingredients with oil</p>
  <p>2. Mix until it forms a smooth paste</p>
  <h3>Forming the scallion pancakes</h3>
  <p>1. Cut the dough into 6 pieces and work on the pieces one at a time. Use your hands to shape the dough into a rectangular shape.</p>
  <p>2. Roll the dough</p>
  <p>3. The dough should form a very thin rectangle</p>
  <p>4. Add the flour oil paste</p>
  <p>5. Spread out the paste, leaving about 1" (2.5cm) on both a long and a short end without the filling (your top and left)</p>
  <p>6. Add the green onion, concentrating most of it towards a long and short end with the filling</p>
  <p>7. Gently roll up the dough, as tightly as possible</p>
  <p>8. Press the air bubbles out of the dough strip</p>
  <p>9. Further roll up the long dough strip</p>
  <p>10. Tuck the end on the bottom</p>
  <p>11. Gently press the tall pancake</p>
  <p>12. Let it rest while you work on the rest of the pancakes</p>
  <h3>Roll and cook the pancakes</h3>
  <p>1. Roll out the pancakes when you're ready to cook</p>
  <p>2. Heat up a pan with a layer of oil on the bottom, add the pancake, and wiggle the pancake a few times so it won't stick</p>
  <p>3. Let the pancake cook covered first</p>
  <p>4. Flip the pancake and cook covered again</p>
  <p>5. Then cook uncovered, until both sides of the pancake are browned</p>
  <p>6. You can use a spatula to press the pancake, to help with even browning</p>
